# CA 02 - Spam Classifier
#### Shaye O'Beirne, Minh Tran, Safiya Carroll

## Description

This notebook takes data from emails and uses a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails either as spam or not spam, based on key words present (or not present) within the emails.

## Necessary Libraries

The necessary libraries for this code to run properly are as follows:

* `os`
* `numpy`
* `collections`
* `pandas`
* `sklearn`

## Data

We are using data from the files 'train-mails' and 'test-mails', as available on Brightspace.
NOTE: the 'train-mails' and 'test-mails' files must be in the same directory as the CA01_NB_assignment.ipynb file in order for the notebook to properly run without error.

## Acknowledgements

Instructions on how to properly implement the Naive Bayes Algorithm through SKLearn can be found at the following link:

## How to Run

Open the CA02_NB_assignment.ipynb file in a text editor (i.e., Visual Studio Code 2) that can run Python 3.11.1
